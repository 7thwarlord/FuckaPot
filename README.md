### <a name='create-a-schedule'></a> 🕑 Create a schedule

#### <a name=github-actions></a> 🐙 GitHub Actions  

- Well, GitHub uses UTC time (UTC + 0) for scheduling workflows, so we should convert it to our timezone.

- For example: If I want to set the daily trigger to trigger at 9:00 PM (UTC + 7), I have to set it to 2:00 PM or 14:00 
(24-hour format) (UTC ± 0) (2 + 7 = 9).

  ```
  name: Daily claim
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 14 * * *' # <- UTC Time, replace 0 14
  ```
- So, if I want the daily trigger to run at 5:00 AM (UTC + 7), I have to set it to 10:00 PM (UTC ± 0) (use 24-hour 
format):
  ```
  name: Daily claim
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 22 * * *' # UTC Time
  ```
  
#### <a name='schedule-linux'></a> 🐧 Linux  
  
1. ```commandline
   crontab -e  
   ```  
2. Add this line at the **bottom** `0 8 * * * python3 /absolut folder path/main.py` to run the script every day at 8:00 
am.  
  
#### <a name='schedule-docker'></a> 🐋 Docker 
  

  
1. You can find the docker container ID by running  
    ```commandline  
    docker ps -a  
    ```
2. ```commandline  
   crontab -e  
   ```  
   Or the windows equivalent via the Task Scheduler.  
3. Add this line at the **bottom**   `0 8 * * * docker start <container_id> && docker stop <container_id>`. 
   Make sure to replace <container_id> with the ID of your Docker container.
   After adding the start command, you have to stop the docker container, or it will run multiple times per minute.
